    * surely fieldz.chan should be name fieldz.channel ...

    * found using netstat -nr that LG had no default route; installed
        one using route add default gw 192.168.1.254

    * NameSpace has been moved into a separate package (xlutil), should 
        be dropped from here

    * segfault seen during each alertz/testWithDummyClient run on 
        stockton
        - no similar behavior on PA
        - libev on stockton is 404 as expected
        - serverutil on stockton is current (2.1.6)
        - on stockton serverutil/testAll succeed
        - Python docs warn that 'foreign' threads might create 'thread
            objects' which will not participate in joins
        - on stockton, messages after "DESTROYING event loop" do not
            appear.  These are 
                "... event loop destroyed
                "JOIN COMPLETE
                "ABOUT TO ACTUALLY CLOSE LOG FILE 0
                ...
                "*** cLog deallocated desc2 successfully ***"
                ...
        - segfault is in serverutil's modFunc.d, about line 78, at
            ev_loop_destroy(loop) invocation
    * possibly unrelated: "WAITING FOR CONNECTION
        "(libev) cannot allocate 2147483632 bytes, aborting"
        - this value is 2GB less 16B
        - this began occurring after a sleep for 150 ms right after
            daemonT.start() was commented out
    * WORKED AROUND THIS by commenting out options.logMgr.close()

    * tidy up and generally shrink the code
    * add an application that lazily builds a web page whenever the 
        log has changed
    * then add a web server to display the web page
    * install alertzd on test, listening on 55555
    * test client can run on uhm supermicro
2012-12-08
    * verify that shutdown message works with zero- and non-zero-length
        remarks
    * modify testAlertzSer to have client just send shutdown message;
        that should work
